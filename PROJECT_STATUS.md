## 📊 System Architecture

### Data Flow (Optimized)
```
Kiosk → Firestore (atomic counter) → Real-time listeners → Dashboard/TV Display
                ↓
            QR Code Generation
                ↓
          Print Ticket
                ↓
    Patient Registration (mobile)
                ↓
          Firestore Update
                ↓
    Real-time listeners update all apps instantly
```

### Key Optimizations
1. **No polling** - All updates via Firestore listeners
2. **Incremental updates** - Only process changed documents
3. **Memoization** - Prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. **Atomic operations** - Queue counter uses Firestore transactions
5. **Safe error handling** - Null checks for all date operations

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Starting the System
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Firebase Emulators
npm run emulators:start

# Terminal 2: Start all apps concurrently
npm run dev:all

# Or start apps individually:
npm run dev:kiosk        # Port 3001 (or 3005)
npm run dev:patient      # Port 3002
npm run dev:dashboard    # Port 3003
npm run dev:tv           # Port 3004
```

### Testing Performance
1. Open Dashboard (localhost:3003)
2. Open TV Display (localhost:3004)
3. Generate queue number from Kiosk (localhost:3005)
4. Observe instant updates on TV Display (<50ms)
5. Register patient via QR code
6. Observe instant update on Dashboard
7. Assign patient to room
8. Observe instant updates on both Dashboard and TV Display
