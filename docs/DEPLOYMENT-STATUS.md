# Automated Cleanup Deployment Status

## Summary

‚úÖ **Code Ready**: The automated cleanup Cloud Function has been implemented and built successfully.
‚ö†Ô∏è **Deployment Issue**: Function deployment requires Firebase **Blaze (Pay-as-you-go)** plan.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Updated Cloud Function
**File**: [functions/src/queue/resetDailyQueue.ts](../functions/src/queue/resetDailyQueue.ts)

The existing `resetDailyQueue` function was enhanced with automatic cleanup:
- Deletes ALL patients from previous days
- Deletes old queue counter documents
- Resets room statuses
- Uses efficient batched writes (handles 500+ records)
- Comprehensive logging

###  2. Schedule
- **Runs**: Daily at midnight (00:00 AM)
- **Timezone**: America/New_York
- **Trigger**: Cloud Scheduler (Pub/Sub)

### 3. Documentation Created
- [AUTOMATED-CLEANUP.md](AUTOMATED-CLEANUP.md) - Complete deployment and monitoring guide
- [CLEANUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md](CLEANUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md) - Manual cleanup instructions
- [CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md](CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md) - System overview

---

## Deployment Issue

### Problem
Scheduled Cloud Functions require:
1. **Firebase Blaze Plan** (Pay-as-you-go)
2. **Cloud Scheduler API** enabled
3. **Billing account** linked to the project

### Current State
The project appears to be on the **Spark (free)** plan, which doesn't support:
- Scheduled functions (Pub/Sub triggers)
- Cloud Scheduler
- Outbound network requests from functions

### Error During Deployment
```
Failed to create function projects/geraldina-queue-manager/locations/us-central1/functions/resetDailyQueue
```

## üéØ Your Options

### Option 1: Upgrade to Blaze Plan (Recommended for Production)

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Fully automated - no manual work needed
- ‚úÖ Professional solution
- ‚úÖ Reliable and consistent
- ‚úÖ Very low cost (~$0-$1/month for this use case)

**Steps**:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `geraldina-queue-manager`
3. Click "Upgrade" in the left sidebar
4. Select "Blaze" plan
5. Link a billing account (Google Cloud)
6. Return to your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions:resetDailyQueue
   ```

**Cost Estimate**:
- Cloud Functions: FREE (within free tier for this usage)
- Cloud Scheduler: FREE (up to 3 jobs)
- Firestore: FREE (within daily quotas)
- **Total**: $0/month (for small hospital usage)

See: [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)

### Option 2: Manual Daily Cleanup (No Upgrade Needed)

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Works with FREE Spark plan
- ‚úÖ Full control over when cleanup runs
- ‚úÖ No ongoing costs

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual work required daily
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk of forgetting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Less professional

**How To**:
1. Every morning before hospital opens
2. Open: https://geraldina-queue-manager-receptionist.web.app
3. Press F12 for console
4. Copy/paste script from [apps/dashboard/cleanup-old-patients.js](../apps/dashboard/cleanup-old-patients.js)
5. Run: `cleanupOldPatients()`
6. Takes ~30 seconds

**Full Instructions**: [README-CLEANUP.md](README-CLEANUP.md)

---

### Option 3: Client-Side Auto-Cleanup (Partial Solution)

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Works with FREE Spark plan
- ‚úÖ Automatic (if dashboard is open)
- ‚úÖ No ongoing costs

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only runs if dashboard is open at midnight
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Less reliable than server-side
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires code changes to dashboard app

**Implementation**:
Would need to add a service in the dashboard app that:
1. Checks if it's past midnight
2. Runs cleanup automatically
3. Marks cleanup as done for the day

**Status**: Not yet implemented (can do if needed)

## ‚úÖ What's Ready Right Now

Even without deploying the Cloud Function, you have:

1. ‚úÖ **Browser Console Script** - Works NOW on production
   - File: [apps/dashboard/cleanup-old-patients.js](../apps/dashboard/cleanup-old-patients.js)
   - Run manually to clean up old data immediately

2. ‚úÖ **Local Testing Tools** - Verified cleanup logic works
   - Seed script: [apps/dashboard/seed-test-patients.mjs](../apps/dashboard/seed-test-patients.mjs)
   - Cleanup script: [apps/dashboard/cleanup-old-patients.mjs](../apps/dashboard/cleanup-old-patients.mjs)

3. ‚úÖ **Cloud Function Code** - Ready to deploy when you upgrade
   - Source: [functions/src/queue/resetDailyQueue.ts](../functions/src/queue/resetDailyQueue.ts)
   - Built: `functions/lib/queue/resetDailyQueue.js`

---

## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Run manual cleanup using browser console script
   - Follow: [README-CLEANUP.md](README-CLEANUP.md)
   - This will fix your current registration issues

### Short-term (This Week)
2. Decide on long-term solution:
   - **For production hospital**: Upgrade to Blaze plan (recommended)
   - **For testing/demo**: Continue manual cleanup

3. If upgrading to Blaze:
   - Takes 5 minutes in Firebase Console
   - Deploy function: `firebase deploy --only functions:resetDailyQueue`
   - Monitor first run: `firebase functions:log`

### Long-term (Optional)
4. Consider implementing client-side auto-cleanup as backup
5. Set up monitoring/alerts for cleanup failures
6. Archive old data before deletion (if historical data needed)
